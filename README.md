Project Title: Super Cool Audio Interactive Mondrian

Luke - Corner triangles mouse hover constraints, effects, mouse position, oscillator type, volume slider (WIP)

Adrian - Color changing center square, frequency based on mouse X movement

Alexander - Overlayed P5JS triangles over image, stretchable top triangle, press space to invert colors

Concept / Inspo: We used a Piet Mondrian piece for this project, as the simple blocky visuals made for a perfect layout for a "drum pad" type project. When the user moves the mouse left to right, the output frequency from the oscillator changes from low to high respectively. Users can click the four different triangular corners to change the oscillator type; if they click the upper middle triangle and move left or right it can be stretched, and if space bar is pressed the colors are inverted (WIP).

Code Concept Taught: 
Triangle hovering interactivity - majority of draw()
Web Audio oscillator - changing oscillator types based on mouse interaction in draw(), dynamic oscType variable initialized at the beginning

Instructions: Move mouse left or right to change output frequency; click any of the four corners to change oscillator type; click and drag upper middle triangle to stretch.
